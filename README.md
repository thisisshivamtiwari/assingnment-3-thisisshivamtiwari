## 🔍 Key Findings & Results

### 🏆 Performance Comparison: Minority Class Metrics

| Model | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Key Characteristics |
|-------|-----------|--------|----------|---------------------|
| **Baseline** | **0.738** | 0.649 | **0.691** | Best precision, balanced performance |
| **SMOTE** | 0.085 | **0.858** | 0.154 | Highest recall, many false positives |
| **CBO** | 0.182 | 0.676 | 0.287 | Better structure preservation than SMOTE |
| **CBU** | 0.039 | **0.865** | 0.075 | Highest recall, poorest precision |

### 🎯 Key Discoveries

1. **🏅 Best Overall Performance: Baseline Model**
   - Highest F1-score (0.691) indicates best balance
   - Best precision (0.738) minimizes false positives
   - Most practical for real-world deployment

2. **📈 Clustering-Based Advantages**
   - **CBO outperforms SMOTE**: Better precision (0.182 vs 0.085) while maintaining high recall
   - **Structure preservation**: Clustering respects data geometry, reducing noise
   - **CBU efficiency**: Highest recall (0.865) with computational benefits

3. **⚠️ SMOTE Limitations Revealed**

### 💼 Business Impact Analysis

**For Fraud Detection Systems:**
- **Baseline Recommended**: Best balance for production systems
- **CBO Alternative**: When recall improvement is crucial
- **Cost Consideration**: False positives require manual investigation (expensive)
- **Risk Management**: Missing fraud (low recall) vs investigation burden (low precision)
